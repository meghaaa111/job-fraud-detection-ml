🚨 Built a Job Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning 🚨

Job scams are becoming increasingly common, so I built an end-to-end ML application that analyzes job descriptions and estimates fraud risk.

🔍 What it does:
• Uses TF-IDF + Logistic Regression to predict fraud probability
• Classifies postings into Low / Medium / High risk
• Highlights suspicious patterns for explainability
• Deployed as an interactive web app

🛠 Tech Stack:
Python | Scikit-learn | Streamlit | Machine Learning

🌐 Live App: https://fxtkysja78dl3pmaafdoqj.streamlit.app/

This project helped me understand real-world ML limitations, risk-based predictions, and explainable AI.

Feedback welcome! 😊
